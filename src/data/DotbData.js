The price to mint a Mutant will start 3 ETH, and gradually reduce to .01 ETH over the course of 9 hours. This is to allow the community to set a fair starting price and,hopefully, avoid any gas war. At the time of minting, Mutant Apes will be unrevealed. Once the public sale has concluded, arandomized starting index will be set and all Mutant Apes will be revealed. This is to prevent anyone, including the founders, from knowing which mutant will be minted during the sale. After the starting index is set and the mutants are revealed, BAYC members will be able to begin mutating their apes with serums here on th site."

The exact time will be announced on Twitter (@BoredapeYC) and in our Discord. Applying a serum to a Bored Ape will burn that serum, and result in a MUTANT NFT which may retain aspects of the original Bored Ape. The Bored Ape NFT will not be harmed. THERE IS NO SET TIME LIMIT FOR APPLYING SERUMS. Remember, a Bored Ape can only be mutated via a vial of a certain type once. We will introduce a method for checking whether a Bored Ape has been exposed to a given vial type."
