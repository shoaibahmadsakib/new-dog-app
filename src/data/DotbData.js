Each dog will cost 0.375 SOL to mint. Try your luck and you might even mint a legendary radioactive, solana, or zombie dog. Did we also mention that your dog serves as your membership to the block and will give you access to upcoming events and voting rights as the project progresses. Dogs live out their lives on the Solana blockchain allowing anyone to trade, buy or sell with each other and of course give full rights of ownership to their masters (no Larva Labs bs)."

These derivative NFTs can be sold on secondary markets and the sale proceeds will go to the artist that created it!",
